// STEP 4
// In order to be able to fetch data from our backend,
// Relay has to know how to do it. For that we will create
// a so-called Relay Environment --- a wrapper around configuration,
// a single data store and network handler.
//
// https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/en/quick-start-guide.html#relay-environment
//
// Keep in mind copy-pasting straight from the documentation won't always work.
// Here, for example, you have to change the URL
// at which Relay will expect the GraphQL endpoint.
